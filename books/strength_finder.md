#Preface

- There is more potential for growth when people invest energy in developing
their strenghts instead of correcting deficiences.
+ comment:
-- Sure, but it is not necessarily the better thing to do always.

- If the manager ignores, 40% chance of disengagment; focuses on weakness, 22%
chance of disengagment; focuses on strenghts, 1% chance of disengagment.

#Part 1
##The Path Of Most Resistance
- "You can be anything you want to be, if you just try hard enough." is a
misguided maxim.
- Rudy Ruettiger's thousands of hours of practice just to get one tackle in a
game was worthless, however inspirational the story is. This is taking the path
of most resistance.
- Focusing on areas and devoting time and attention  where a student gets low
grades is a problem.
- Michael Jordan couldn't become great at baseball, however hard he tried.
- "You cannot be anyting you want to be - but you can be a lot more of who you
already are."
+ comment:
++ I am not sure about this. While I do agree that unless naturally
talented, even 10 years of practice is not going to make you the greatest - the
high bar being set here (Michael Jordan). But these thousands of hours
practicing will get you to a much better position that just ignoring it. Maybe
this job is a necessity. Maybe this is what you really like even though you are
not the best at it - is it always true that you only enjoy what you are good at?
++ There are very valid cases where your not-strenght areas might need some work
so that the strenght/talent area get better. I find it hard to just write such
areas off and not focus on them.
++ It is not also not always necessary that one needs to be achieve mastery in
the areas of talent. There are plenty of cases where the not-strength/talent
areas be actually very marketable and help achieve all the things needed.
++ This also puts a pre-requisite that we know what the areas of strength are -
hence the book! - and be able to apply them to the day-to-day jobs, again
described in the book. So I guess if the book works, great! I'd rather read this
with a grain of salt and focus on the additive advice.
