- There is more potential for growth when people invest energy in developing
their strenghts instead of correcting deficiences.
-- comment: Sure, but it is not necessarily the better thing to do always.

- If the manager ignores, 40% chance of disengagment; focuses on weakness, 22%
chance of disengagment; focuses on strenghts, 1% chance of disengagment.
